### **Project 1: Soft Robotic Coffee Berry Harvester Using Twisted and Coiled Polymer (TCP) Actuators**  
**Pain Point**: Thai coffee farms (e.g., in Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai) face labor shortages and rely on manual picking, which is slow and risks damaging delicate coffee berries. Damaged berries reduce bean quality and export value.  

#### **Proof of Concept (PoC) Plan**  
**Objective**: Build a soft gripper that gently harvests coffee berries using TCP actuators.  
**Steps**:  
1. **Design**:  
   - Create a 3D-printed gripper with two TCP "fingers" (made from nylon fishing line, coiled and annealed).  
   - Integrate a low-voltage Joule heating system (5-12V) to contract the TCP muscles.  
   - Add a simple Arduino-based control system for timed gripping/releasing.  
2. **Prototyping**:  
   - Test the gripper on artificial coffee berries (3D-printed or silicone models) and real berries (provided by partnering farms).  
   - Measure grip force (<1 N to avoid bruising) and success rate (berries detached without damage).  
3. **Field Testing**:  
   - Collaborate with a local coffee farm to trial the gripper on a small plot.  
   - Compare harvesting speed and berry damage rates against manual picking.  

#### **Feasibility Analysis**  
- **Technical**:  
  - TCP actuators are low-cost (~$5/meter), easy to fabricate, and require minimal power (solar-compatible).  
  - Challenge: Integrating vision systems for berry detection (initially manual targeting).  
- **Resource**:  
  - Requires 3D printer, fishing line, and basic electronics (total PoC cost: ~$200).  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Prototype in 4 weeks, field tests in 8 weeks.  

#### **Viability Analysis**  
- **Cost-Benefit**:  
  - Labor costs for coffee harvesting in Thailand average $10â€“15/day per worker.  
  - A robotic system could reduce labor needs by 30â€“50%, paying back in 1â€“2 seasons for small farms.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Modular design allows multiple grippers on a single drone or mobile platform for larger farms.  
- **Partnerships**:  
  - Partner with Thai Coffee Association or Doi Chaang Coffee for pilot funding.  

#### **Desirability Validation**  
- **Farmer Interviews**:  
  - Survey 5â€“10 coffee farmers to prioritize needs (e.g., labor reduction vs. berry quality).  
  - Adjust gripper design based on feedback (e.g., ergonomic handles for hybrid human-robot use).

### **Project 2: Soil Moisture Mapping Robots with Hygroscopic Actuators**  
**Pain Point**: Uneven irrigation in mountainous Thai coffee farms leads to overwatering (fungal growth) or underwatering (low yields).  

#### **Proof of Concept (PoC) Plan**  
**Objective**: Develop a worm-like robot that autonomously burrows into soil, triggered by humidity, to map moisture levels.  
**Steps**:  
1. **Design**:  
   - Use hygroscopic cellulose-chitosan strips (from rice husk waste) as actuators.  
   - 3D-print a segmented body that expands/contracts with humidity changes to mimic peristaltic motion.  
   - Embed a low-cost soil moisture sensor (e.g., capacitive sensor) in the robotâ€™s tip.  
2. **Prototyping**:  
   - Test burrowing efficiency in soil samples with varying moisture (dry, moist, wet).  
   - Validate moisture data against commercial sensors (e.g., Teralytic).  
3. **Field Testing**:  
   - Deploy in a small coffee farm plot to create a moisture map.  

#### **Feasibility Analysis**  
- **Technical**:  
  - Cellulose-chitosan actuators are biodegradable and respond to ambient humidity (no power needed).  
  - Challenge: Slow actuation speed (~1 cm/hour).  
- **Resource**:  
  - Rice husks are abundant in Thailand (free material). Total PoC cost: ~$150.  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Prototype in 6 weeks (material curing time).  

#### **Viability Analysis**  
- **Cost-Benefit**:  
  - Commercial soil sensors cost $100â€“300/unit. This robot could undercut prices while providing mobility.  
  - Reduces water waste by 20â€“40%, critical in drought-prone regions.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Farmers can deploy multiple robots across plots. Data syncs via LoRaWAN for low-power connectivity.  
- **Partnerships**:  
  - Partner with Thailandâ€™s Royal Irrigation Department for subsidies.  

#### **Desirability Validation**  
- **Farmer Feedback**:  
  - Demo the robotâ€™s moisture maps and compare crop yields pre/post-deployment.  
  - Prioritize user-friendly data interfaces (e.g., SMS alerts for dry zones).

### **Recommendation: Start with the Coffee Berry Harvester**  
**Why**:  
1. **Immediate Impact**: Addresses labor shortages and quality loss, directly boosting farmer income.  
2. **Low Technical Risk**: TCP actuators are well-documented and easy to prototype.  
3. **Partnership Leverage**: Coffee farms are eager to adopt tech that preserves their premium bean status (e.g., Thai Arabica).  

**Next Steps**:  
1. **Contact Coffee Farms**:  
   - Reach out to Doi Tung Development Agency or Akha Ama Coffee in Chiang Mai for collaboration.  
2. **Build MVP**:  
   - Focus on a handheld, human-assisted gripper first (reduces complexity vs. full automation).  
3. **Grant Funding**:  
   - Apply for Thai government grants (e.g., National Innovation Agencyâ€™s AgTech fund).
